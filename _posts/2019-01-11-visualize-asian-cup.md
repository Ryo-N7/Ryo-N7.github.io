Another year, another big soccer/football tournament! This time it’s the
top international competition in Asia, the [Asian Cup](http://www.the-afc.com/asiancup/) hosted in the
U.A.E. In this blog post I’ll be covering (responsible) web-scraping, data wrangling
(tidyverse FTW!), and of course, data visualization with `ggplot2`.

Let’s get started!

Packages
--------

``` r
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, scales, lubridate, ggrepel, stringi, magick, 
               glue, extrafont, rvest, ggtextures, cowplot, ggimage, polite)
# Roboto Condensed font (from hrbrmstrthemes)
loadfonts()
```

Top Goalscorers of the Asian Cup
--------------------------------

The first thing I looked at was, “Who are the top goalscorers in the
history of the Asian Cup?”

Here I use the [polite](https://github.com/dmi3kno/polite) package to
take a look at the `robots.txt` for the web page and see if it is OK to
web scrape from it. First you pass the URL to the `bow()` function, check that you are
indeed allowed to scrape, then use `scrape()` to retrieve data, and the
rest is the usual `rvest` web-scraping workflow.

``` r
topg_url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Asian_Cup_records_and_statistics"

session <- bow(topg_url)

ac_top_scorers <- scrape(session) %>%
  html_nodes("table.wikitable:nth-child(29)") %>% 
  html_table() %>% 
  flatten_df() %>% 
  select(-Ref.) %>% 
  set_names(c("total_goals", "player", "country"))
```

For brevity, let’s only take a look at the top 5 goal scorers. I’ll also
`mutate()` in a nice image of a soccer ball for the data points on the
plot.

``` r
ac_top_scorers <- ac_top_scorers %>% 
  head(5) %>% 
  mutate(image = "https://www.emoji.co.uk/files/microsoft-emojis/activity-windows10/8356-soccer-ball.png")
```

I made something slightly different to your standard bar graph as I
use the `geom_isotype_col()` function from `ggtextures` to create a bar
of soccer ball images. Compared to other functions in `ggtextures`,
`geom_isotype_col()` allows each image to correspond to the value of the
variable you are plotting, in this case 1 ball = 1 goal!

``` r
ac_top_graph <- ac_top_scorers %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(player, total_goals), y = total_goals,
             image = image)) +
  geom_isotype_col(img_width = grid::unit(1, "native"), img_height = NULL,
    ncol = NA, nrow = 1, hjust = 0, vjust = 0.5) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14),
                     expand = c(0, 0), 
                     limits = c(0, 15)) +
  ggthemes::theme_solarized() +
  labs(title = "Top Scorers of the Asian Cup",
       subtitle = "Most goals in a single tournament: 8 (Ali Daei, 1996)",
       y = "Number of Goals", x = NULL,
       caption = glue("
                      Source: Wikipedia
                      By @R_by_Ryo")) +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Roboto Condensed"),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 22),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 16),
        axis.line.y = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.y = element_blank())

ac_top_graph
```

OK, not bad. However, wouldn’t it be nice to add a bit more context? Specifically, 
which country these players came from. So let’s add some flags along the y-axis!

There are lots of different ways to do this (like `geom_flag()` from the
`ggimage` package) but I ended up doing it the `cowplot` way. I had to
tweak the scales a bit as the flags came in different sizes. When you
plot, you just insert the image strip into the bar plot with
`axis_canvas()` and combine all the parts together with `ggdraw()`!

``` r
axis_image <- axis_canvas(ac_top_graph, axis = 'y') + 
  draw_image("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Flag_of_Iran.svg", 
             y = 13, scale = 1.5) +
  draw_image("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Flag_of_South_Korea.svg", 
             y = 10, scale = 1.7) +
  draw_image("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9e/Flag_of_Japan.svg", 
             y = 7, scale = 1.7) +
  draw_image("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Flag_of_Iraq.svg", 
             y = 4, scale = 1.6) +
  draw_image("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Flag_of_Kuwait.svg", 
             y = 1, scale = 1.2)

ggdraw(insert_yaxis_grob(ac_top_graph, axis_image, position = "left"))
```

Ideally I wanted the soccer balls to be the official balls from the
tournament that the player scored in. However, I couldn’t find a nice
emoji-fied/icon-ized version and there was also the “small” problem in
that there was no “official” Asian Cup ball until the 2004 tournament in
China! You can take a look at the official Asian Cup balls
[here](http://football-balls.com/balls/asian-cup).

Winners of the Asian Cup
------------------------

We saw that the top goal scorers came from Iran, South Korea, Japan,
Iraq, and Kuwait but did their goal scoring exploits lead their nations
to glory? Let’s find out!

When web-scraping I really like using `flatten_df()` after
`html_table()` as I don’t have to use the awkward looking `.[[1]]`
within my piped workflow.

``` r
acup_url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Asian_Cup"

session <- bow(acup_url)

acup_winners_raw <- scrape(session) %>% 
  html_nodes("table:nth-child(31)") %>% 
  html_table() %>% 
  flatten_df()
```

Now I can use the `clean_names()` function to quickly clean up my column names
(mainly when I can’t be bothered to `set_names()` them myself…).

The next steps are splitting up the number of times a team placed
between 1st and 3rd and the year that occurred with `separate()`. Then variants of `mutate()` are used to tidy the string columns of the data into numeric type. I use `gather()` so each team will have a row for each of the rank positions (1st-3rd). Finally, I arrange the data in a way that the facets will be ordered in the way that I want.

``` r
acup_winners_clean <- acup_winners_raw %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  slice(1:8) %>% 
  select(-fourth_place, -semi_finalists, -total_top_four) %>% 
  separate(winners, into = c("Champions", "first_place_year"), 
           sep = " ", extra = "merge") %>% 
  separate(runners_up, into = c("Runners-up", "second_place_year"), 
           sep = " ", extra = "merge") %>% 
  separate(third_place, into = c("Third Place", "third_place_year"), 
           sep = " ", extra = "merge") %>% 
  mutate_all(funs(str_replace_all(., "–", "0"))) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(contains("num")), funs(as.numeric)) %>% 
  mutate(team = if_else(team == "Israel1", "Israel", team)) %>% 
  gather(key = "key", value = "value", -team, 
         -first_place_year, -second_place_year, -third_place_year) %>% 
  mutate(key = key %>% 
           fct_relevel(c("Champions", "Runners-up", "Third Place"))) %>% 
  arrange(key, value) %>% 
  mutate(team = as_factor(team),
         order = row_number())
```

I plot using facets on the “key” variable (containing the rank data) so
that we can see how many times each team placed as Champions to Third
Place. I also use the `glue()` function here to format the multi-line
captions and titles in a neat way.

``` r
acup_winners_clean %>% 
  ggplot(aes(value, team, color = key)) +
  geom_point(size = 5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Champions" = "#FFCC33",
                                "Runners-up" = "#999999",
                                "Third Place" = "#CC6600"),
                     guide = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Number of Occurrence",
       title = "Winners & Losers of the Asian Cup!",
       subtitle = glue("
                       Ordered by number of Asian Cup(s) won.
                       Four-time Champions, Japan, only won their first in 1992!"),
       caption = glue("

  facet_wrap(~key) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Roboto Condensed"),
        title = element_text(size = 18),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.title.y = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, size = 10),
        panel.border = element_rect(fill = NA, colour = "grey20"),

Goals per Game
--------------

One new thing I learned very recently, while working on this viz in
fact, was using [magrittr aliases](https://twitter.com/Emil_Hvitfeldt/status/1081080919073542144)! In this workflow I always wind up having to use `.[x]` or
`.[[x]]` but now I can just use `extract()` or `extract2()` respectively
to do the same thing!

``` r
wiki_url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org"
session <- bow(wiki_url)
acup_url <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Asian_Cup"
session_cup <- bow(acup_url)

cup_links <- scrape(session_cup) %>% 
  html_nodes("br+ i a") %>% 
  html_attr("href") %>% 
  magrittr::extract(-17:-18)

acup_df <- cup_links %>% 
  as_data_frame() %>% 
  mutate(cup = str_remove(value, "\\/wiki\\/") %>% str_replace_all("_", " ")) %>% 
  rename(link = value)
```

Another cool thing I found while scraping this data was the `jump_to()`
function that allows you to navigate to a new URL. This makes
`map()`-ing over multiple URL links from a base URL very easy! Here, the
base URL is the AFC Asian Cup Wikipedia page and the function iterates
over each of the URL links of the respective tournament pages.
Another way that I could’ve done this was to `map()` over the different
dates of the tournaments as the Wikipedia page of each edition of the
Asian Cup only differed in the “year” appended at the beginning of the
URL.

``` r
goals_info <- function(x) {
  goal_info <- scrape(session) %>% 
    jump_to(x) %>% 
    html_nodes(".vcalendar") %>% 
    html_table(header = FALSE) %>% 
    flatten_df() %>% 
    spread(key = X1, value = X2) %>% 
    select(`Goals scored`) %>% 
    mutate(`Goals scored` = str_remove_all(`Goals scored`, pattern = ".*\\(") %>% 
             str_extract_all("\\d+\\.*\\d*") %>% as.numeric)
}

team_num_info <- function(x) {
  team_num_info <- scrape(session) %>% 
    jump_to(x) %>% 
    html_nodes(".vcalendar") %>% 
    html_table(header = FALSE) %>% 
    flatten_df() %>% 
    spread(key = X1, value = X2) %>% 
    select(`Teams`) %>% 
    mutate(`Teams` = as.numeric(`Teams`))
}

match_num_info <- function(x) {
  match_num_info <- scrape(session) %>% 
    jump_to(x) %>% 
    html_nodes(".vcalendar") %>% 
    html_table(header = FALSE) %>% 
    flatten_df() %>% 
    spread(key = X1, value = X2) %>% 
    janitor::clean_names() %>% 
    select(matches_played) %>% 
    mutate(matches_played = as.numeric(matches_played))
}

# all together:
goals_data <- acup_df %>% 
  mutate(goals_per_game = map(acup_df$link, goals_info) %>% unlist,
         team_num = map(acup_df$link, team_num_info) %>% unlist,
         match_num = map(acup_df$link, match_num_info) %>% unlist)
```

Next, I clean it up a bit and add in the number of teams that participated
in each tournament.

``` r
ac_goals_df <- goals_data %>% 
  mutate(label = cup %>% str_extract("[0-9]+") %>% str_replace("..", "'"),
         team_num = case_when(
           is.na(team_num) ~ 16,
           TRUE ~ team_num
         )) %>% 
  arrange(cup) %>% 
  mutate(label = factor(label, label),
         team_num = c(4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 10, 10, 10, 8, 12, 12, 16, 16, 16, 16))

glimpse(ac_goals_df)
```

    ## Observations: 16
    ## Variables: 6
    ## $ link           <chr> "/wiki/1956_AFC_Asian_Cup", "/wiki/1960_AFC_Asi...

    ## $ team_num       <dbl> 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 10, 10, 10, 8, 12, 12, 16, 16...

Now we make a line graph but with __lots__ of `annotate()` code to add in
comments, labels, and segments for the labels. At the end I use
`geom_emoji()` to add a soccer ball to the plot for each of the data
points.

``` r
plot <- ac_goals_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = label, y = goals_per_game, group = 1)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(NA, 5.35),
                     breaks = c(1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5)) +
  labs(x = "Tournament (Year)", y = "Goals per Game") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(text = element_text(family = "Roboto Condensed"),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 12)) +
  annotate(geom = "label", x = "'56", y = 5.15, family = "Roboto Condensed",
           color = "black", 
           label = "Total Number of Games Played:", hjust = 0) +

           label = "24", family = "Roboto Condensed") +
  annotate(geom = "segment", x = 7, xend = 9, y = 4.8, yend = 4.8) +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = "'92", y = 4.9,

```

<img src="../assets/2019-01-11-visualize-asian-cup_files/unnamed-chunk-109-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

``` r
ggsave(filename = glue("{here::here('Asian Cup 2019')}/gpg_plot_final.png"), 
       width = 8, height = 7, dpi = 300)
plot <- image_read(glue("{here::here('Asian Cup 2019')}/gpg_plot_final.png"))
```

However, I’m not finished yet! I wanted to try to make this look a bit
more “official” so I attempted to add the Asian Cup logo on the top
right corner. There are probably alternative ways to how I did it below,
especially by using grobs, but I was reminded of
[this](https://www.danielphadley.com/ggplot-logo/) blog post by [Daniel
Hadley](https://twitter.com/danielphadley) who used the `magick` package
to add a footer with a logo onto a `ggplot` object. I’ve used `magick`
before for animations and this was a good chance to try it out for image
editing. Compared to Daniel Hadley’s example I needed to have the logo
on the right corner so I had to create a blank canvas with `image_blank()` and then placing everything on top of that with `image_composite()` and `image_append()`.

``` r
logo_raw <- image_read("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ad/2019_afc_asian_cup_logo.png")

logo_proc <- logo_raw %>% image_scale("600")

# create blank canvas
a <- image_blank(width = 1000, height = 100, color = "white")
# combine with logo image and shift logo to the right
b <- image_composite(image_scale(a, "x100"), image_scale(logo_proc, "x75"), 
                     offset = "+880+25")
# add in the title text
logo_header <- b %>% 
  image_annotate(text = glue("Goals per Game Throughout the History of the Asian Cup"),
                 color = "black", size = 24, font = "Roboto Condensed",
                 location = "+63+50", gravity = "northwest")

# combine it all together! 
final2_plot <- image_append(image_scale(c(logo_header, plot), "1000"), stack = TRUE)

# image_write(final2_plot,
#             glue("{here::here('Asian Cup 2019')}/gpg_plot_final.png"))

final2_plot
```

<img src="../assets/2019-01-11-visualize-asian-cup_files/unnamed-chunk-110-1.png" width="1000" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

All in all it took a while to tweak the positions of the text and logo
image but for my first try it worked well. There is definitely room for
improvement in regards to sizing and scaling though.

Ultimately, I couldn’t find much information on why those tournaments in
the 80s in particular were such low scoring affairs. I wasn’t alive to
watch those games on TV nor could I find any illuminating articles or
blog posts on the style of Asian football back then… This was also
before Japan really got into soccer so there wasn’t anything I could
find in Japanese either.

Japan’s Record vs. Historical Rivals and Group D Opponents
----------------------------------------------------------

Japan is the most successful team in the competition with 4
championships but who are their opponents in the group stages and how
have they fared against them in the past? While I’m at it I will also check Japan's
records against long-time continental rivals such as Iran, South Korea,
Saudi Arabia and more recently, Australia.

The data I’m going to use comes from
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017)
which has all international football results from 1872 to the World Cup
final last year. To add in the federation affiliation (UEFA, AFC, etc.)
for each of the countries I slightly modified some code from one of the
kernels, [“A Journey Through The History of
Soccer”](https://www.kaggle.com/phjulien/a-journey-through-the-history-of-soccer/)
by PH Julien.

``` r
federation_files <- Sys.glob("../data/federation_affiliations/*")

df_federations = data.frame(country = NULL, federation = NULL)
for (f in federation_files) {
    federation = basename(f)
    content = read.csv(f, header=FALSE)
    content <- cbind(content,federation=rep(federation, dim(content)[1]))
    df_federations <- rbind(df_federations, content)
}

colnames(df_federations) <- c("country", "federation")

df_federations <- df_federations %>% 
  mutate(country = as.character(country) %>% str_trim(side = "both"))
```

Now to load the results data and then join it with the affiliations
data.

``` r
results_raw <- read_csv("../data/results.csv")

results_japan_raw <- results_raw %>% 
  filter(home_team == "Japan" | away_team == "Japan") %>% 
  rename(venue_country = country, 
         venue_city = city) %>% 
  mutate(match_num = row_number())

# combine with federation affiliations
results_japan_home <- results_japan_raw %>% 
  left_join(df_federations, 
            by = c("home_team" = "country")) %>% 
  mutate(federation = as.character(federation)) %>% 
  rename(home_federation = federation) 

results_japan_away <- results_japan_raw %>% 
  left_join(df_federations, 
            by = c("away_team" = "country")) %>% 
  mutate(federation = as.character(federation)) %>% 
  rename(away_federation = federation)

# combine home-away
results_japan_cleaned <- results_japan_home %>% 
  full_join(results_japan_away)
```

Next I need to edit some of the continents for teams that didn’t have a
match in the federation affiliation data set, for example, “South Korea”
is “Korea Republic” in the Kaggle data set.

``` r
results_japan_cleaned <- results_japan_cleaned %>% 
  mutate(
    home_federation = case_when(
      home_team %in% c(
        "China", "Manchukuo", "Burma", "Korea Republic", "Vietnam Republic",
        "Korea DPR", "Brunei") ~ "AFC",
      home_team == "USA" ~ "Concacaf",
      home_team == "Bosnia-Herzegovina" ~ "UEFA",
      TRUE ~ home_federation),
    away_federation = case_when(
      away_team %in% c(
        "China", "Manchukuo", "Burma", "Korea Republic", "Vietnam Republic",
        "Korea DPR", "Brunei", "Taiwan") ~ "AFC",
      away_team == "USA" ~ "Concacaf",
      away_team == "Bosnia-Herzegovina" ~ "UEFA",
      TRUE ~ away_federation
    ))
```

Now that it’s nice and cleaned up I can reshape it so that the data is
set from Japan’s perspective.

``` r
results_jp_asia <- results_japan_cleaned %>% 
  # filter only for Japan games and AFC opponents
  filter(home_team == "Japan" | away_team == "Japan",
         home_federation == "AFC" & away_federation == "AFC") %>% 
  select(-contains("federation"), -contains("venue"),
         -neutral, -match_num,
         date, home_team, home_score, away_team, away_score, tournament) %>% 
  # reshape columns to Japan vs. opponent
  mutate(
    opponent = case_when(
      away_team != "Japan" ~ away_team,
      home_team != "Japan" ~ home_team),
    home_away = case_when(
      home_team == "Japan" ~ "home",
      away_team == "Japan" ~ "away"),
    japan_goals = case_when(
      home_team == "Japan" ~ home_score,
      away_team == "Japan" ~ away_score),
    opp_goals = case_when(
      home_team != "Japan" ~ home_score,
      away_team != "Japan" ~ away_score)) %>% 
  # label results from Japan's perspective
  mutate(
    result = case_when(
      japan_goals > opp_goals ~ "Win",
      japan_goals < opp_goals ~ "Loss",
      japan_goals == opp_goals ~ "Draw"),
    result = result %>% as_factor() %>% fct_relevel(c("Win", "Draw", "Loss"))) %>% 
  select(-contains("score"), -contains("team"))
```

With all that done we can take a look at how Japan have done against
certain opponents by using `filter()`.

``` r
results_jp_asia %>% 
  filter(opponent == "Jordan",
         tournament == "AFC Asian Cup")
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 7
    ##   date       tournament    opponent home_away japan_goals opp_goals result
    ##   <date>     <chr>         <chr>    <chr>           <int>     <int> <fct> 
    ## 1 2004-07-31 AFC Asian Cup Jordan   home                1         1 Draw  
    ## 2 2011-01-09 AFC Asian Cup Jordan   home                1         1 Draw  
    ## 3 2015-01-20 AFC Asian Cup Jordan   home                2         0 Win

Unfortunately, this data set doesn’t go into extra-time or penalty wins
as Japan’s Quarter-Final meeting with Jordan in 2004 ended with Japan
securing a route to the semis, [4-3 on penalties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dyuWq0-KTw)!

I can create a function that’ll filter for certain opponents and
tournaments and aggregate the results. With the second argument being
`...`, `tidyeval` allows me to input any kind of filter condition for an
opponent, tournament, etc. The `if else` statement protects against
cases where Japan never had that type of result against an opponent and
makes sure that a column populated by 0s is created.

``` r
japan_versus <- function(data, ...) {
  # filter 
  filter_vars <- enquos(...)
  
  jp_vs <- data %>% 
    filter(!!!filter_vars) %>% 
    # count results type per opponent
    group_by(result, opponent) %>% 
    mutate(n = n()) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    # sum amount of goals by Japan and opponent
    group_by(result, opponent) %>% 
    summarize(j_g = sum(japan_goals),
              o_g = sum(opp_goals),
              n = n()) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    # spread results over multiple columns
    spread(result, n) %>% 
    # 1. failsafe against no type of result against an opponent
    # 2. sum up counts per opponent
    group_by(opponent) %>% 
    mutate(Win = if("Win" %in% names(.)){return(Win)} else{return(0)},
         Draw = if("Draw" %in% names(.)){return(Draw)} else{return(0)},
         Loss = if("Loss" %in% names(.)){return(Loss)} else{return(0)}) %>% 
    summarize(Win = sum(Win, na.rm = TRUE),
              Draw = sum(Draw, na.rm = TRUE),
              Loss = sum(Loss, na.rm = TRUE),
              `Goals For` = sum(j_g),
              `Goals Against` = sum(o_g))
  
  return(jp_vs)
}
```

Now let’s try it out a bit.

``` r
japan_versus(data = results_jp_asia, 
             opponent == "China")
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 6
    ##   opponent   Win  Draw  Loss `Goals For` `Goals Against`
    ##   <chr>    <int> <int> <int>       <int>           <int>
    ## 1 China       14     8    10          54              45

I can put in multiple filter conditions if needed as well.

``` r
japan_versus(data = results_jp_asia,
             home_away == "home",
             opponent %in% c("Palestine", "Vietnam", "India"))
```

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 6
    ##   opponent    Win  Draw  Loss `Goals For` `Goals Against`
    ##   <chr>     <int> <dbl> <dbl>       <int>           <int>
    ## 1 India         2     0     0          13               0
    ## 2 Palestine     1     0     0           4               0
    ## 3 Vietnam       1     0     0           1               0

As you can see Japan has never lost or drawn against India, Palestine,
or Vietnam so in the data there wouldn’t have been any rows with “Loss”
in the results column. With the function I created I was able to impute
results that didn’t exist and fill them in with 0s!

Let’s check Japan’s performance against our main rivals in the Asian
Cup. Here I make the tables look a lot nicer with the options in the
`kable` and `kableExtra` packages.

``` r
results_jp_asia %>% 
  japan_versus(opponent %in% c("Iran", "Korea Republic", "Saudi Arabia"),
               tournament == "AFC Asian Cup") %>% 
  knitr::kable(format = "html",
               caption = "Japan vs. Historic Rivals in the Asian Cup") %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) %>% 
  kableExtra::add_header_above(c(" ", "Result" = 3, "Goals" = 2))
```

Now let’s take a look at how Japan have historically played against the
other teams in __Group F__ of this year’s Asian Cup (in all competitions).

``` r

We see no rows here for Turkmenistan. This is due to the fact that until
just this past week Japan had **never** played against them in a
friendly or competitive game!

Conclusion
==========

In this blog post I went through a few examples of visualizing some very
basic stats on the Asian Cup happening this month. I'll devote this last
section on my views on this edition of the Asian Cup and Japan's national 
team. 

Although Japan’s first game was quite horrible I’m hoping it’ll wake 
the players and coaches out of their complacency and not underestimate our
opponents in the next two games. Thankfully, South Korea should be on the other side of the bracket for the knock-out stages and we would also only meet Iran in the semifinals 
(provided both teams finish top of their respective groups). Japan could 
meet Australia in the Quarters but without Aaron Mooy they’re a much 
weaker side as shown in their abject loss to Jordan in their opening 
match.

Even with losing our new star, Shoya Nakajima, to injury the fact that we
can replace him with a player of the calibre of Takashi Inui and with 
Hannover regular, Genki Haraguchi, stepping up from the bench shows how
much Japanese football has progressed these past 25 years.

It’s a changing of the guard for Japan after the retirement of captain Hasebe
and Keisuke Honda but with more Japanese players headed to Europe from 
a young age these are exciting times to be a Japanese football fan. It's been 
quite awe-inspiring seeing how the number of Japanese players playing for 
foreign clubs have been steadily increasing since the 1988 Asian Cup squad (Japan's first
appearance at a major tournament, minus the Olympics).

This tournament is the first hurdle for this new generation of players as they
fight to become regulars for the national team and begin the journey to the next 
World Cup in 2022. Here's hoping for another great month of football!
