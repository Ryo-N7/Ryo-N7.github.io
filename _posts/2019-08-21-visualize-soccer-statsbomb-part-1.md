This will be **Part 1** of what I hope to be a multi-part series of
plotting soccer event-level data with R! This is more of a tutorial blog
post rather than a deep analytical piece but I will give some context to
the examples to set the scene! I can’t give an exact number of how many
parts as I am still getting to grips with this kind of data and I feel
like I’ve only scratched the surface. You can read some of the other
stuff I’ve done, preview blog posts for the [Asian
Cup](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-01-11-visualize-asian-cup/) and the
[Copa
America](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-06-18-visualize-copa-america/),
along with the code to all the standalone viz I’ve done on my
[soccer\_ggplot GitHub
repository](https://github.com/Ryo-N7/soccer_ggplots).

I’ll mostly be using the **Messi Data Biography** data but the steps I
show below are applicable to the other data available as well! I will be
working with the **free** data sets so some things may differ compared
to the full data available. Also note that it is possible to create the
viz in this blog post using data from other providers of event-level
data such as Opta. The difference in code will mainly be in the data
ingestion and cleaning phases but the gist of the {ggplot2} code should
be similar.

As an example and motivation, one of the visualizations we are going to
create is shown below:

Let’s get started!

Getting the Data
================

A few important steps before you even start using R:

-   Please read the [StatsBomb/Open-Data Github
    repository](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data)
-   Register your details
    [here](https://www.statsbomb.com/resource-centre)
-   Read and agree to the [User
    Agreement](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data/blob/master/LICENSE.pdf)
-   Install the {StatsBombR} package via
    `devtools::install_github("statsbomb/StatsBombR")`
-   You might also want to take a look at the documentation found
    [here](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data/tree/master/doc)

Once that’s done we can start coding!

Packages
========

Here’s all the packages I’ll be using (note: I like using {pacman} so I
don’t have to repeat `library()` a billion times):

``` r
if (!require("pacman")) {
  install.packages("pacman")
}

pacman::p_load(tidyverse, ## mainly dplyr, purrr, and tidyr
               StatsBombR, SBpitch, soccermatics,
               extrafont, ggupset, tibbletime,
               ggtext, ggrepel, glue,
               patchwork, cowplot, gtable, grid,
               magick)

## loading fonts
loadfonts(device = "win", quiet = TRUE)
```

After loading the
[{StatsBombR}](https://github.com/statsbomb/StatsBombR) library (note:
that I already did this above but just showing it again below for
demonstrational purposes) we first want to take a look at the output of
the `FreeCompetitions()` function which gives you a data frame of all
the competitions available for free from StatsBomb. Do note that this
part will be different if you are a customer using the API.

``` r
library(StatsBombR)
comps <- FreeCompetitions()

glimpse(comps)
```

If you `View()` or `glimpse()` the data frame you’ll see that the
`competition_id` we need is **11** for the Lionel Messi data. We use
this to `filter()` the `comps` data frame and then call `FreeMatches()`
to get a data frame of the available matches. Finally pass that data
frame to `StatsBombFreeEvents()` to access the data, this can take a
while if you don’t have a good internet connection!

``` r
messi_matches_raw <- comps %>% 
  filter(competition_id == 11) %>% 
  FreeMatches()

messi_data_raw <- StatsBombFreeEvents(MatchesDF = messi_matches_raw)
```

Clean All and Add Season Labels
-------------------------------

Now that we’ve got the raw data we can clean it and add some extra
information using the `allclean()` function. This function takes care
of:

-   `cleanlocations()`: cleans the location variables in the data
-   Goalkeeper: Add goalkeeper data from the freeze frame
-   Shot: Adds more shot information
-   Freeze frame: Extracts info from freeze frames, i.e. density
-   Defensive: Defensive information

We can also add in the actual season names by joining with the “comps”
data frame and joining it by the “season\_id”.

``` r
messi_data_clean <- messi_data_raw %>% 
  allclean() %>%  
  left_join(comps %>% select(season_id, season_name), by = "season_id")
```

The player names in the data are the full names and for lots of
Spanish/Portuguese players in the data that means their **FULL** names.
To make the names shorter and so that labels on plots can be more
legible it’s a good idea to clean the “name” variables up a bit. There
is a function, `JoinPlayerNickName()` that allows you to do that,
however, you need a username and password for the StatsBomb API, which I
don’t have sooo… I have several options:

-   Manually clean the names…
-   Find a nice list of player names and `left_join()` after cleaning
    -   Example: Use `transfermarkt` data
-   Use the [{fuzzyjoin}](https://github.com/dgrtwo/fuzzyjoin) package:
    Join a name even if there are `n` number of differences

In the end I just did it manually… around 10 full minutes of hard
concentration and it was done. Added bonus is that now I am intimately
familiar with the full names of every Barcelona player in the past
decade!

``` r
messi_data_clean <- messi_data_clean %>%

I only changed it for these two variables but you could do it for more
using the scoped variants of `mutate()` such as `mutate_at()` or
`mutate_if()` to change the values of variables that adhere to certain
conditions.

Save Cleaned Data
-----------------

Now that we’ve got a clean data set it might be a good idea to save it.
I use the `here::here()` function for setting the path root to the
top-level of the current project directory and then jumping into the
“data” folder. Read this blog post
[here](https://malco.io/2018/11/05/why-should-i-use-the-here-package/)
for more info on why it’s useful to do so.

``` r
saveRDS(messi_data_clean, file = here::here("data/messi_data_clean.RDS"))
```

To get data for the other data sets it’s a matter of finding and
filtering for the correct “competition\_id”. For the Women’s World Cup
data that’ll be **72** and for the Men’s World Cup last year it’ll be
**43**. The other data cleaning steps are the same.

With a nice clean data set ready, we can move on to reshaping the data
for analysis and plotting!

xG Timeline
===========

Data
----

To get the data for a single match, in this case an **“El Clasico”**
match from the 2011/2012 season, we `filter()` for its “match\_id”
number. Our main statistic of interest for the next two plots is going
to be xG in the “shot.statsbomb\_xg” variable. If the value for it is
`NA` we can safely set the value to **0**, otherwise we just keep the
value for that row.

We also create a separate data set that sums up the total xG for both
teams and creates a nice label using the {glue} package. The
“team\_label” variable will come in handy in the plots. After joining
that data frame in, we also create a “player\_label” variable to store
the “player.name” and “shot.statsbomb\_xg” values for rows where a
**Goal** was scored. This variable will also be used as labels in the
plots.

``` r
clasico_1112 <- messi_data_clean %>% 
  filter(match_id == 69334) %>% 
  mutate(shot.statsbomb_xg = if_else(is.na(shot.statsbomb_xg), 
                                     0, shot.statsbomb_xg))

clasico_1112_xg <- clasico_1112 %>% 
  group_by(team.name) %>% 
  summarize(tot_xg = sum(shot.statsbomb_xg) %>% signif(digits = 2)) %>% 
  mutate(team_label = glue::glue("{team.name}: {tot_xg} xG"))

clasico_1112 <- clasico_1112 %>% 
  left_join(clasico_1112_xg, by = "team.name") %>% 
  mutate(player_label = case_when(
    shot.outcome.name == "Goal" ~ glue::glue("{player.name}: {shot.statsbomb_xg %>% signif(digits = 2)} xG"),
    TRUE ~ ""))
```

Plot
----

There’s several components to this plot. First, there is a timeline
going across the plot showing the total minutes of the game, this is
done with `geom_segment()` and setting the `x` and `xend` to **0** and
**95** respectively while the `y` and `yend` arguments are kept to zero
as there shouldn’t be any movement along the y-axis. Second, there are
green segments highlighting when an actual goal was scored in the game,
done via the `geom_rect()` function and passing data where the
“shot.outcome.name” variable had the value, **Goal**. I added a small
two minute buffer on either side of the goal time to create a
rectangular highlight. Last but certainly not least, are the
`geom_point()`s of different sizes (depending on the value of XG)
showing the xG events throughout the match.

If you’ve worked with fonts and {ggplot2} before you might think it’s
weird that I’m calling `windowsFonts()` below. Normally I wouldn’t, but
I can’t seem to get the fonts to show up properly when I stitch multiple
plots together (in a later section) so I had to resort to doing it this
way. If you want to just create a standalone plot then the
`windowsFonts()` code isn’t needed and you can call the font family in
`theme()` as you would normally (after doing the {extrafont} stuff at
the beginning). This is something peculiar with fonts and certain
Operating Systems and you may experience different problems or none at
all on your computer.

``` r
windowsFonts(robotoc = windowsFont("Roboto Condensed"))

clasico_xg_timelineplot <- clasico_1112 %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_segment(x = 0, xend = 95,
               y = 0, yend = 0) +

Alone and without x-axis labels it doesn’t amount to much but in
combination with the next two plots it’ll all come together nicely.

xG Accumulated Plot
===================

While the previous plot highlights certain xG events throughout the
match it doesn’t give you a sense of the ebb and flow of the game
through the lens of xG. This next plot adds up the total xG of teams
over time which can show periods of dominance and the spread of high/low
xG shots across a match.

Data
----

Similar to the previous plot except we’re just taking the cumulative sum
over time using the `cumsum()` function. We put a `lag()` on it so that
both teams start off with 0 xG at minute 0. To help with the labels for
our plot we `left_join()` the same data frame except only for rows where
there was a goal. Then we create slightly different versions of the
minutes (“minute\_goal”) and rollsum (“rollsum\_goal”) variables for the
goals so they line up properly on the plot. For the actual label we use
`glue::glue()` to glue together the values of the “player.name” variable
and the “sumxg” variable (only for rows where the shot outcome is equal
to **Goal**).

``` r
clasico_rollsum <- clasico_1112 %>% 
  group_by(minute, team.name, period) %>% 
  summarize(sumxg = sum(shot.statsbomb_xg)) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(team.name) %>% 
  mutate(rollsum = lag(cumsum(sumxg)),
         rollsum = if_else(is.na(rollsum), 0, rollsum)) %>% 
  select(team.name, minute, rollsum, sumxg) %>%
  mutate(rollsum = case_when(
    row_number() == n() & sumxg != 0 ~ rollsum + sumxg,
    TRUE ~ rollsum
  ))

clasico_rollsum <- clasico_rollsum %>% 
  left_join(clasico_1112 %>% filter(shot.outcome.name == "Goal") %>% select(minute, shot.outcome.name, team.name, player.name), 
            by = c("minute", "team.name")) %>% 
  mutate(rollsum_goal = rollsum + sumxg,

Plot
----

If you’re familiar with R, this is a simple line plot. However, there’s
still a lot of work to be done to make it look nice. By setting the
breaks, labels, and limits in `scale_x_continous()` we can properly
label the time along the x-axis. For the y-axis, I use the `sec_axis()`
function to attach labels for each team’s total xG at the end of the
line, more specifically the y-axis on the opposite side. To save on some
space we can also move the legend into a more accessible place in the
plot by specifying the coordinates in the `legend.position` argument of
`theme()`. We can also use the new
[{ggtext}](https://github.com/clauswilke/ggtext) package to add more
styling to the text in the labels and titles using CSS/HTML. Using
`geom_point()` and `geom_label_repel()` we can add markers to signify
when goals were scored along with who the goal scorer was and the xG
value of the shot.

Real Madrid had higher xG throughout the match (boosted considerably by
the first goal less than 30 seconds in which had an xG value of 0.54)
yet it was Barcelona who scored 3 goals from an xG of 0.78 to win the
game.

Final Third Passes
==================

In this plot we look at a rolling sum (using a window of 5 minutes) of
the passes that were made by each team in the final third of the field.

Data
----

We `group_by()` each team and the minute to count the number of events
that had a value of “Pass” with the condition that they happened in the
final third of the field (“location.x” &gt;= 80).

``` r
roll_final_pass <- clasico_1112 %>% 
  group_by(team.name, minute) %>% 
  mutate(count = case_when(
    type.name == "Pass" & location.x >= 80 ~ 1L,
    TRUE ~ 0L
  )) %>% 
  select(team.name, minute, count) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

The main problem here is that not every minute is included in the data
due to a variety of factors, for this game, there isn’t any “Pass” data
for the 93rd minute for either team and no pass data for Barcelona in
the entirety of the 14th minute. So even if we apply our rolling sum
function it wouldn’t be accurate as it’ll won’t be taking into account
the rows for those missing minutes. We just need to create another data
frame that has every combination of the minutes throughout the match for
each team. I use `tidyr::crossing()` here but there are other ways to do
this.

``` r
first_min <- clasico_1112$minute %>% unique() %>% first()
last_min <- clasico_1112$minute %>% unique() %>% last()
minute <- c(first_min:last_min)
team.name <- c("Real Madrid", "Barcelona")

crossing(minute, team.name) %>% slice(26:32)
```

    ## # A tibble: 7 x 2
    ##   minute team.name  
    ##    <int> <chr>      
    ## 1     12 Real Madrid
    ## 2     13 Barcelona  
    ## 3     13 Real Madrid
    ## 4     14 Barcelona  
    ## 5     14 Real Madrid
    ## 6     15 Barcelona  
    ## 7     15 Real Madrid

Now there’s a row for the missing minutes as well and now we can take
this crossed data frame and join it with the passing data frame. Then we
sum up the number of passes for each minute interval and then apply a
`rolling_sum()` function. This custom function is created using
`tibbletime::rollify()`. To use this function, specify an input function
to be used for the rolling window, in our case `sum()` and the window to
be of length 5. In the final line we `filter()` the data so we only take
the rows for each 5 minute interval and the last row (the 94th minute).

``` r
rolling_sum <- tibbletime::rollify(.f = sum, window = 5)

roll_clasico_pass <- crossing(minute, team.name) %>%
  left_join(roll_final_pass, by = c("minute", "team.name")) %>% 
  group_by(team.name, minute) %>% 
  summarize_all(sum) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(count = ifelse(is.na(count), 0, count)) %>% 
  group_by(team.name) %>% 
  mutate(rollsum = rolling_sum(count),
         rollsum = ifelse(is.na(rollsum), 0, rollsum)) %>% 
  group_by(team.name) %>% 
  select(-count) %>% 
  filter(row_number() %% 5 == 1 | row_number() == n())

roll_clasico_pass %>% head(5)
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 x 3
    ## # Groups:   team.name [1]
    ##   team.name minute rollsum
    ##   <chr>      <int>   <dbl>
    ## 1 Barcelona      0       0
    ## 2 Barcelona      5       3
    ## 3 Barcelona     10       5
    ## 4 Barcelona     15       1
    ## 5 Barcelona     20       5

Plot
----

This is similar to the previous plot but with the addition of
`geom_point()` to add markers for the number of final third passes at
the 5 minute intervals we just created. We change the shape of the
points to **21** (a hollow circle) so that we can fill the inside with
the color of each team specified in `scale_fill_manual()`. We also set
the stroke to **2.5** so that the outline of the circle is a bit
thicker.

As a standalone plot it’s nice as you can see which team was on the
offensive at different points throughout the game. However, it might be
even more useful if we can look at this data in combination with some of
the other plots we created previously which leads us to the next
section…

All Together Now!
=================

You can combine several of the plots we made above to create a nice
infographic that summarizes the game using this kind of data. I’m sure
you’ve seen some of these online such as
[this](https://twitter.com/WomensFootyStat/status/1147930874647896067)
from [Women’s Footy Stat](https://twitter.com/WomensFootyStat) among
others. The two packages I normally use are
[{patchwork}](https://github.com/thomasp85/patchwork/) and
[{cowplot}](https://github.com/wilkelab/cowplot/) for this kind of job
but with the {ggtext} formatting as well as how wonky fonts work on
Windows and R I had to resort to using {grid} and {gtable} to combine
the plots without the text getting messed up on rendering.

``` r
library(gtable)
library(grid)

png(filename = here::here("Lionel Messi/output/clasico_match_plot_RAW.png"), 
    width = 1000, height = 1600, res = 144, bg = "white")

one <- ggplotGrob(finalthird_rollingplot)
two <- ggplotGrob(clasico_xg_timelineplot)

gg <- rbind(one, two, size = "last")
gg$widths <- unit.pmax(one$widths, two$widths)

grid.newpage()
grid.draw(gg)
dev.off()
```

    ## png 
    ##   2

If you don’t want to include the {ggtext} stuff then using
`cowplot::plot_grid()` with the arguments `align` set to **v** for
vertical alignment, **h** for horizontal alignment, and `axis` set to
**l** for left margin alignment works just fine.

``` r
## ...delete all {ggtext} code and resave ggplot objects...
clasico_match_plot <- plot_grid(finalthird_rollingplot,
          clasico_xg_timelineplot, ncol = 1,
          align = "hv", axis = "l")

ggsave(plot = clasico_match_plot,
       filename = here::here("Lionel Messi/output/clasico_match_plotRAW.png"),
       height = 14, width = 10)
```

Nice! However, we’ve got one last thing to do which is to add the
StatsBomb logo to our plot as per their user agreement. For this I’ll
use a special function, `add_logo()` (mainly based on the
[{magick}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html)
package) created by [Thomas Mock](https://twitter.com/thomas_mock) that
I always use for appending logos onto plots.

``` r
add_logo <- function(plot_path, logo_path, logo_position, logo_scale = 10){

    # Requires magick R Package https://github.com/ropensci/magick

    # Useful error message for logo position
    if (!logo_position %in% c("top right", "top left", "bottom right", "bottom left")) {
        stop("Error Message: Uh oh! Logo Position not recognized\n  Try: logo_positon = 'top left', 'top right', 'bottom left', or 'bottom right'")
    }

    # read in raw images
    plot <- magick::image_read(plot_path)
    logo_raw <- magick::image_read(logo_path)

    # get dimensions of plot for scaling
    plot_height <- magick::image_info(plot)$height
    plot_width <- magick::image_info(plot)$width

    # default scale to 1/10th width of plot
    # Can change with logo_scale
    logo <- magick::image_scale(logo_raw, as.character(plot_width/logo_scale))

    # Get width of logo
    logo_width <- magick::image_info(logo)$width
    logo_height <- magick::image_info(logo)$height

    # Set position of logo
    # Position starts at 0,0 at top left
    # Using 0.01 for 1% - aesthetic padding

    if (logo_position == "top right") {
        x_pos = plot_width - logo_width - 0.01 * plot_width
        y_pos = 0.01 * plot_height
    } else if (logo_position == "top left") {
        x_pos = 0.01 * plot_width
        y_pos = 0.01 * plot_height
    } else if (logo_position == "bottom right") {
        x_pos = plot_width - logo_width - 0.01 * plot_width
        y_pos = plot_height - logo_height - 0.001 * plot_height
    } else if (logo_position == "bottom left") {
        x_pos = 0.01 * plot_width
        y_pos = plot_height - logo_height - 0.01 * plot_height
    }

    # Compose the actual overlay
    magick::image_composite(plot, logo, offset = paste0("+", x_pos, "+", y_pos))
}
```

We input the finished plot that we just saved as well as the path to the
StatsBomb logo that I have saved in an “img” folder. We can then set the
`logo_position` and the `logo_scale` (relative to the plot) and save it
using `magick::image_write()`.

``` r
plot_logo <- add_logo(
  plot_path = here::here("Lionel Messi/output/clasico_match_plot_RAW.png"),
  logo_path = here::here("img/stats-bomb-logo.png"),
  logo_position = "bottom right",
  logo_scale = 5)

plot_logo
```

<img src="../assets/2019-08-21-visualize-soccer-statsbomb-part-1_files/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png" width="1000" />

``` r
## Save Plot
magick::image_write(
  image = plot_logo, 
  path = here::here("Lionel Messi/output/clasico_match_plot_FIN.png"))
```

With the plot done, let me give you a bit of context to this game. After
Real Madrid scored a goal within the first minute, it became a tight
game with either side not really being able to string many passes in the
final third. However, Alexis Sanchez was able to score the equalizer
against the run of play from a Messi through ball around the 30th minute
([Video of Sanchez’s
goal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkoKJ-Ao4i4)), during a period
where Real Madrid had a lot of final third passes and created several
chances in quick succession (albeit of low xG values). Barca’s two later
goals came from sustained pressure of their own in the final third.
Although Barcelona were able to close the gap on Real Madrid to just 3
points there was still half a season to go and defeats to Osasuna and
Real Madrid in the return fixture proved to be their undoing.

With the StatsBomb data available and the plot-stitching R packages
shown above you can make similar plots or combine any two, three, or
even four plots to provide an overview of a match or season! You could
also add in text-only ggplot objects and combine it with the plots to
make an infographic, the possibilities are endless!

Pass Partner Plots
==================

These next few plots explore the passing partnerships between all the
Barcelona players. Rather than a full pass network graph this is simply
looking at things from a more micro-level by counting up the frequency
in which two players exchanged passes with each other. From a
visualization standpoint there are problems with using a standard bar
chart due to the long labels needed along the x-axis. One option is to
put the player names on the y-axis however it’s not always the best to
do so. Another way is to use **“upset plots”** which visualizes the set
intersections by a matrix located around the main plot.

I used the [{ggupset}](https://github.com/const-ae/ggupset/) package but
there are alternatives such as {UpsetR} which provides some additional
features. The choice is a matter of preference, as for me, I liked how
seamlessly {ggupset} worked with the existing {ggplot2} API. Before we
get to plotting we need to manipulate the data we have to that we get
the right variables to pass to the plotting functions.

Data: All Passes Received in the Box
------------------------------------

If you check the data you’ll see that the majority of the values in the
`pass.outcome.name` variable are set to NA and you might think that
there’s a lot of missing data. However, the empty values are all
actually “Complete” passes. To make this more explicit we can use the
`fct_explicit_na()` function to set those NAs to “Complete” while also
turning the variable into a factor.

Following that we `filter()` for event types that are specifically
“Pass”-es that have a “Complete” outcome from the team “Barcelona” that
only come from open play and where the passes end up in the opposition’s
box. You can find out the exact coordinates to set up the filtering for
passes into the box (and any other area of the pitch you have in mind)
by taking a look at page 34 of StatsBomb’s [Open Data Specification
(version
1.1)](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data/blob/master/doc/StatsBomb%20Open%20Data%20Specification%20v1.1.pdf).

From there we `select()` the variables we want to keep, you can use a
select helper function such as `contains()` to grab all variables
containing the string that you supply, in this case all of the “pass”
variables, “pass.angle”, “pass.length”, etc.

Then for each season we count the number of passes between a player
(“player.name”) and the recipient of the pass (“pass.recipient.name”)
and call this variable “pass\_num”. After making sure we `ungroup()` we
edit the “player.name” variable so that it includes both the name and
the number of passes they made (the “pass\_num” variable we just
created).

Finally, {ggupset} expects the variable that we are creating the plot
for to be in a list form. So we create a new list variable “pass\_duo”
whose elements contain the passer’s name (“player.name”) and the pass
recipient’s name (“pass.recipient.name”).

``` r
pass_received_all_box <- messi_data_clean %>% 
  mutate(pass.outcome.name = fct_explicit_na(pass.outcome.name, "Complete")) %>%
  filter(type.name == "Pass",
         team.name == "Barcelona",
         pass.outcome.name == "Complete",
         ## Only passes from open play
         !play_pattern.name %in% c("From Corner", "From Free Kick",
                                   "From Throw In"),
         ## Only passes that ended up inside the box:
         pass.end_location.x >= 102 & pass.end_location.y <= 62 &
           pass.end_location.y >= 18) %>% 
  select(player.name, pass.recipient.name, 
         season_id, season_name,
         position.name, position.id,
         location.x, location.y,
         pass.end_location.x, pass.end_location.y,
         contains("pass")) %>% 
  group_by(season_name) %>% 
  add_count(player.name, pass.recipient.name, name = "pass_num") %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(player.name = glue::glue("{player.name}: {pass_num}")) %>% 
  mutate(pass_duo = map2(player.name, pass.recipient.name, ~c(.x, .y))) %>% 
  select(player.name, pass.recipient.name, pass_num, 
         season_name, pass_duo)
```

Now we can get to the actual plotting!

As we have data for multiple seasons, instead of repeating the {ggplot2}
code for every year we can create a “base plot” for every season and
store it inside the data frame via nesting. To do the nesting, you need
to `group_by()` the season and then call `nest()`. As you can see below
this creates a column called “data” which holds all the variables and
values from each of the seasons listed in “season\_name”.

``` r
pass_received_all_box %>% 
  group_by(season_name) %>% 
  nest()
```

    ## # A tibble: 8 x 2
    ##   season_name           data
    ##   <chr>       <list<df[,4]>>
    ## 1 2004/2005         [46 x 4]
    ## 2 2005/2006         [96 x 4]
    ## 3 2006/2007        [127 x 4]
    ## 4 2007/2008        [152 x 4]
    ## 5 2008/2009        [249 x 4]
    ## 6 2009/2010        [267 x 4]
    ## 7 2010/2011        [296 x 4]
    ## 8 2011/2012        [253 x 4]

With the way the data frame is set up now, you can use `mutate()` to
create a new variable column containing the plots for each season! If
you want to do this, especially if you also want to programatically add
in the season name to each of the plots you need to use the
`purrr::map2()` function. By passing the “data” and “season\_name”
variables to the function we can ensure that they can be used in the
code to create the plots. Here we’re passing the “data” as vector `.x`
and the “season\_name” as vector `.y`, these notations are the ones
we’ll use to refer to these variables inside the actual {ggplot2}
function call itself.

Using the `~` to denote that the following code is the function we want
to use, we start building out plot. As can be seen the first argument
“data” is set to the `.x` argument that we set before as the data for a
specific season. The main code for the upset pot comes in
`scale_x_upset()` where you can set the number of intersections to plot,
in this case **10** for ten different passer-pass receiver pairings.
Within `theme_combmatrix()` you can set the usual theme elements for a
plot as well as upset matrix specific aspects such as the line and
point’s color and size as well as spacing for the text.

``` r
all_pass_nested_box <- pass_received_all_box %>% 
  group_by(season_name) %>% 
  nest() %>%
  mutate(plot = map2(
    .x = data, .y = season_name,
    ~ ggplot(data = .x, aes(x = pass_duo)) +
      geom_bar(fill = "#a70042") + 
      scale_x_upset(n_intersections = 10,
                    expand = c(0.01, 0.01)) +
      scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0.04, 0.04)) +
      labs(title = glue::glue("
                              Total Completed Passes Into The Box 
                              Between All Players ({.y})"),
           subtitle = "'Name: Number' = Passer, 'No Number' = Pass Receiver",
           x = NULL, y = "Number of Passes") +
      theme_combmatrix(
        text = element_text(family = "Roboto Condensed", 
                            color = "#004c99"),
        plot.title = element_text(family = "Roboto Condensed", size = 20,
                                  color = "#a70042"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(family = "Roboto Condensed", size = 16,
                                     color = "#004c99"),
        axis.title = element_text(family = "Roboto Condensed", size = 14,
                                  color = "#004c99"), 
        axis.text.x = element_text(family = "Roboto Condensed", size = 12,
                                   color = "#004c99"),
        axis.text.y = element_text(family = "Roboto Condensed", size = 12,
                                   color = "#004c99"),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        combmatrix.panel.point.size = 4,
        combmatrix.panel.point.color.fill = "#a70042",
        combmatrix.panel.line.color = "#a70042",
        panel.grid = element_line(color = "black"),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank())))

glimpse(all_pass_nested_box)
```

    ## Observations: 8
    ## Variables: 3
    ## $ season_name <chr> "2004/2005", "2005/2006", "2006/2007", "2007/2008"...
    ## $ data        <list<df[,4]>> Ronaldinho: 5       , Ronaldinho: 5      ...
    ## $ plot        <list> [<Ronaldinho: 5, Ronaldinho: 5, Deco: 3, Deco: 3,...

Now you can check out the 8th element of the “plot” variable which
corresponds to the 2011/2012 season:

``` r
all_pass_nested_1112 <- all_pass_nested_box$plot[[8]] +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = seq(0, 15, by = 5),
                     breaks = seq(0, 15, by = 5),
                     limits = c(0, 15))

ggsave(plot = all_pass_nested_1112,
       filename = here::here("Lionel Messi/output/allpass_1112_plotRAW.png"),
       height = 6, width = 8)

plot_logo <- add_logo(
  plot_path = here::here("Lionel Messi/output/allpass_1112_plotRAW.png"),
  logo_path = here::here("img/stats-bomb-logo.png"),
  logo_position = "top right",
  logo_scale = 5)

plot_logo
```

<img src="../assets/2019-08-21-visualize-soccer-statsbomb-part-1_files/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png" width="2400" />

``` r
## Save Plot
magick::image_write(
  image = plot_logo, 
  path = here::here("Lionel Messi/output/allpass_1112_plotFIN.png"))
```

You can add in whatever other {ggplot2} functions in as needed but this
way you don’t have to type out the entire code block for each season;
you can just tweak and adjust the “base plot” we created in the “plot”
variable of the nested data frame!

As can be seen above a little more work needs to be done concerning the
axis-labels. Although Messi is labelled having made 7 passes, they are 7
passes **EACH** to Alexis Sanchez, Iniesta, Cristian Tello, and Dani
Alves so the total really should read as 28.

Data: Shot Assists
------------------

Just to show another example let’s look at shot assists instead. Besides
the differences inside `filter()` the code is the same (minus label and
title parts too of course):

``` r
## Data
messi_all_shot_assist <- messi_data_clean %>% 
  mutate(pass.outcome.name = fct_explicit_na(pass.outcome.name, "Complete")) %>%
  filter(team.name == "Barcelona",
         !is.na(pass.shot_assist),
         !play_pattern.name %in% c("From Corner", "From Free Kick",
                                   "From Throw In")) %>% 
  select(player.name, pass.recipient.name, 
         season_id, season_name,
         position.name, position.id,
         location.x, location.y,
         pass.end_location.x, pass.end_location.y,
         contains("pass")) %>% 
  group_by(season_name) %>% 
  add_count(player.name, pass.recipient.name, name = "pass_num") %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(player.name = glue::glue("{player.name}: {pass_num}")) %>% 
  mutate(pass_duo = map2(player.name, pass.recipient.name, ~c(.x, .y))) %>% 
  select(player.name, pass.recipient.name, pass_num, 
         season_name, pass_duo)

## Nest plots
messi_nested_all_shot_assist <- messi_all_shot_assist %>% 
  group_by(season_name) %>% 
  nest() %>%
  mutate(plot = map2(
    data, season_name,
    ~ ggplot(data = .x, aes(x = pass_duo)) +
      geom_bar(fill = "#a70042") + 
      scale_x_upset(n_intersections = 10,
                    expand = c(0.01, 0.01)) +
      scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0.04, 0.04)) +
      labs(title = glue::glue("Shot Assists ({.y})"),
           subtitle = "'Name: Number' = Passer, 'No Number' = Pass Receiver",
           caption = "Source: StatsBomb",
           x = NULL, y = "Number of Passes") +
      theme_combmatrix(
        text = element_text(family = "Roboto Condensed", 
                            color = "#004c99"),
        plot.title = element_text(family = "Roboto Condensed", size = 20,
                                  color = "#a70042"),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(family = "Roboto Condensed", size = 16,
                                     color = "#004c99"),
        axis.title = element_text(family = "Roboto Condensed", size = 14,
                                  color = "#004c99"), 
        axis.text.x = element_text(family = "Roboto Condensed", size = 12,
                                   color = "#004c99"),
        axis.text.y = element_text(family = "Roboto Condensed", size = 12,
                                   color = "#004c99"),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        combmatrix.panel.point.size = 4,
        combmatrix.panel.point.color.fill = "#a70042",
        combmatrix.panel.line.color = "#a70042",
        panel.grid = element_line(color = "black"),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank())))

## Plot 2011/2012
messi_nested_all_shot_assist$plot[[8]] +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = seq(0, 12, by = 2),
                     breaks = seq(0, 12, by = 2),
                     limits = c(0, 12))
```

It might be a good idea to combine these plots with other visualizations
such as a pass frequency table and/or a pass network map. For looking at
completed passes into the box you could create some pass maps
highlighting Zone 14 or the Half-Spaces like the ones [Between the
Posts](https://betweentheposts.net/match-plots/) create for their match
reports. For the shot assists plot above we might also want to put it
side-by-side with an xG plot to show whose passes created high xG value
chances.

I only used upset plots for two different elements (the passer and the
pass receiver) but the advantages of this visualization method becomes
more pronounced with even more set intersections so there remains more
room for applying these to other types of soccer viz. For example you
could extend this to look at the most frequent passing sequences between
3 players or 4 or even 5. From the first example one of the top passing
sequences between 3 players might be something like Victor Valdes -
Busquets - Xavi/Iniesta. The matrix underneath the plot may become a bit
unwieldy without some filtering and tweaking by setting different values
for `n_intersections`, `n_sets`, and others in `scale_x_upset()`.

Conclusion
==========

In this blog post I went over some simple plots (dot, line, and bar
charts) you can do using {ggplot2} with the free StatsBomb data. There’s
plenty more to do with this data and I’m still experimenting and
learning everyday. A good way to practice is to take something someone
has done and then recreate that visualization by applying it to a
slightly different data set with your favorite programming language.
This is exactly how I learned to do things; I’ll see something on
Twitter and try to remake that viz using Liverpool data or J-League data
instead!

    Plots](https://betweentheposts.net/match-plots/)
-   And many many more…

If I can refine/improve upon any of the above then I’ll show my own
version of these in a future part.

If you want to iterate this process over many players/teams/seasons
there are ways to do so using the `purrr::map()` family of functions or
`for loops` along with the `nest()` approach I used for the pass partner
plots. You might also be interested in creating automated parameterized
reports with RMarkdown using this data, some resources include [“The
lazy and easily distracted report writer” by Mike Smith at
RStudioConf::2019](https://github.com/MikeKSmith/RStudioConf2019) and

Definitive
Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/parameterized-reports.html).
You may also want to have a unified theme to all your plots, I talk

and there’s other great resources like
[this](https://rfortherestofus.com/2019/08/themes-to-improve-your-ggplot-figures/) that you might want to read.

Part 2 will be more xG plots and also on plotting out the data on soccer
pitches using packages like
