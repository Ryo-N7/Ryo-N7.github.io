title: About Me
---

Born in Japan, grew up in America and Israel, having also lived in Germany, just returned from London and currently residing in **Tokyo**. I'm quite proud to say that I am a citizen of the world!

Recently finished a **MSc. in Industrial-Organizational and Business Psychology** at the University College London (UCL). My main interests is research in consumer behavior, behavioral economics, and influencing/motivating behavioral change for the public good.

My interest in R comes from my belief in the need for more **reproducibility** and **accountability** in psychological and consumer research that can be attained by using R, GitHub, and other open-source software/tools to facilitate increased **transparency** between researchers and the general public. My main strengths in R are in **data wrangling** and **visualization**, many examples of which you can see throughout my blog posts!

Other interests include Soccer/Football, Star Wars, and of course Data Science!

Recently became a **Data analytics and Viz intern** with **ACDI/VOCA**, an international development NGO!

Maintainer & co-author of the [bulletchartr](https://github.com/ACDIVOCATech/bulletchartr) package.

_**Currently looking for full-time opportunities in Tokyo or remote work!**_

## Education

* **MSc** Industrial-Organizational and Business Psychology: University College London, UK  
    + Dissertation title: "Emoji and the Implicit Association Test for Uncovering Implicit Attitudes Toward Brands and Different Race Advertisement SpokesEmoji"    
    + Supervisor: Dr. Dimitrios Tsivrikos
    + Abstract: "The present study combines the usage of the **Implicit Association Test** (IAT) in consumer research with **emoji**, a set of graphics used increasingly throughout computer-mediated communications including marketing and advertising messages. Study 1 demonstrates that emoji can be used as the valence attributes in a simple IAT categorization task. Study 2 goes further by demonstrating the convergent validity of the IAT using emoji valence attributes with explicit attitude measures in a situation where consumers had no reason to hide their beliefs. Study 3 demonstrated the contrast between explicit and implicit measures towards advertisements featuring **Black and White skin tone emoji** as advertisement spokespersons (SpokesEmoji) that revealed divergent responses in Black and White respondents. Overall, the results support the usage of pleasant and unpleasant emoji as IAT valence attributes. In addition, the IATâ€™s **ability to test consumer attitudes toward different racial spokespersons represented by emoji** is a benefit to researchers in marketing and advertising, an area where the usage of emoji continues to grow."
